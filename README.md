# Code Labs Academy - Redux Toolkit Workshop

**üë®‚Äçüíª This repository serves as a support for the youtube video on the [React Global State - Redux Toolkit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7mq-k8AC08&t=1641s) Workshop**

## About this workshop

Redux is an official ReactJS tool. We can easily manage the state of our apps in React by creating a global state of our app using Redux. Take a look at how we can manage state throughout our app using the newly created Slice API from the Redux Toolkit.

In this workshop, you will learn how to use Redux. 

Check the official documentation of Redux from [here](https://redux.js.org/).
